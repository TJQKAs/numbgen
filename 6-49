```
puts "hi we generate some numbers from 1 to 49"
puts "note the file to write"
filename = gets.chomp.to_s
text = open(filename, "w")
puts "how many times do you want to repeat"
time = gets.chomp.to_i
timef = 0
while timef != time 	
arran = Array.new(6){|var| var = rand(49)+1 }.uniq.sort
if arran.size == 6
puts arran 
text.write(arran)
text.write("\n")
timef = timef + 1 
else
timef = timef
end	
end
text.close
```
This is my first program which generates six numbers from 1 to 49 range and writes it as the amount of arrays to the text file.
Further I hope to improve this program by adding some statistical filters, so on....
